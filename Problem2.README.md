## 2) (yeah, I skipped the 1st one):<br />
In this problem you'll have to face a very easy problem that's not even worth solving, but you can try anyway if you have nothing to do.<br />
You have a CountDown component that displays the time left untile a given deadline with the following format: Days:Hours:Minutes:Seconds.<br >
You have two tasks:<br/>
### 1.<br />
Implement the display function so that the remaining time will be renedered in the format specified above.
### 2.<br />
Implement a class decorator that will update the clock. **DO NOT write anything inside the CountDown component other than implementing the display function**.You must pass the deadline as a parameter to the decorator. It can be of type string, number, or Date. Ex: "4/13/2021 16:50:00", 1618319421628, new Date("Tue Apr 13 2021 17:10:06 GMT+0400 (Georgia Standard Time)"). When the time is up, the decorator **must** alert the user with the text "Time is up!" **before** the finish page component will be rendered.
